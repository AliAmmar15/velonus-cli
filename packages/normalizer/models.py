"""models.py — Canonical data models for the Velonus scanner pipeline.

NormalizedFinding is the single source-of-truth shape shared by:
  - All scanner detectors (via RawFinding → NormalizedFinding conversion)
  - The CLI formatters (terminal, JSON, SARIF)
  - The API layer (Phase 2 — stored in PostgreSQL as findings)
  - The AI engine (Phase 2 — prioritization, scoring, remediation)

Severity and Confidence enums are defined here (not in apps/cli) so that
packages/normalizer, packages/scanner/pipeline.py, and packages/ai-engine
can all use them without importing from the CLI package.

apps/cli/shield/core/output.py re-exports Severity and Confidence from here
for backward compatibility with all existing CLI code.
