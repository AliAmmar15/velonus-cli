"""pip_audit.py — pip-audit dependency vulnerability runner for the Velonus scanner pipeline.

pip-audit is an official Python Packaging Authority (PyPA) tool that audits
Python environments and requirement files for known vulnerabilities by querying
the Python Packaging Advisory Database (PyPI/OSV).

This module wraps the pip-audit CLI as a subprocess, parses its JSON output,
and returns findings in the canonical RawFinding shape shared across all detectors.

PIPELINE ORDER: PipAuditRunner runs last — after SecretsDetector (priority 0),
BanditRunner (priority 1), and SemgrepRunner (priority 2).
See PIPELINE_PRIORITY = 3.

Subprocess invocation (project scan)::

    pip-audit --format json --progress-spinner off -r <requirements_file>

    --format json            Machine-readable JSON output (required for parsing)
    --progress-spinner off   Suppress the animated progress indicator to stderr
    -r <requirements_file>   Scan a specific requirements file

Subprocess invocation (project-mode scan — fallback when no requirements file found)::

    pip-audit --format json --progress-spinner off
    (run from the target directory so pip-audit auto-detects pyproject.toml etc.)

    No --local flag. If no dependency files exist in target, the scan is skipped.

Auto-detection logic (in order of preference):
  1. requirements.txt in target directory
  2. requirements-dev.txt in target directory
  3. requirements/*.txt files in target directory
  4. pyproject.toml / setup.cfg / setup.py / Pipfile.lock in target directory
     (pip-audit auto-detects these when run from the project directory)
  5. Skip — return [] with an info log when no dependency files are found

Important: there is NO --local fallback. Scanning the installed environment
when the target has no dependency files would produce findings from the user's
virtualenv (e.g., dev tool CVEs) that have nothing to do with the scanned
project. This is a source of false positives and must be avoided.

Exit code behaviour (pip-audit spec):
    0  — no vulnerabilities found
    1  — vulnerabilities found (NOT an error — output is valid JSON)
    2+ — real error (bad arguments, pip-audit internal crash, network failure)

pip-audit is expected to be installed in the same virtual environment as Shield.
If not found on PATH, a warning is logged and [] is returned so the pipeline
continues unblocked.

Severity mapping: pip-audit does not provide severity ratings. We map based on
CVSS v3 base score embedded in the vulnerability data when available:
    CVSS >= 9.0   → CRITICAL
    CVSS >= 7.0   → HIGH
    CVSS >= 4.0   → MEDIUM
    CVSS >= 0.1   → LOW
    No CVSS data  → MEDIUM (safe default — known vulnerability, unknown severity)

CWE mapping: pip-audit findings represent CWE-1035 (Vulnerable Third Party Component),
a OWASP-aligned CWE for using packages with known vulnerabilities.
OWASP category: A06:2021 (Vulnerable and Outdated Components).
