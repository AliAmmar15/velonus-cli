"""safety.py — Safety dependency vulnerability runner for the Velonus scanner pipeline.

Safety checks Python packages against a curated database of known security
vulnerabilities. It is maintained by pyup.io and covers the same PyPI ecosystem
as pip-audit, but draws from a different advisory database (Safety DB / OSV).

Running both pip-audit (PIPELINE_PRIORITY=3) and Safety (PIPELINE_PRIORITY=4)
gives broader vulnerability coverage — each tool may surface advisories the
other misses. The deduplication layer in Phase 1 handles overlapping CVEs.

This module wraps the ``safety check`` CLI as a subprocess, parses its JSON
output (both v1 and v2 formats), and returns findings in the canonical
RawFinding shape shared across all detectors.

PIPELINE ORDER: SafetyRunner runs last in the pipeline — after SecretsDetector
(priority 0), BanditRunner (priority 1), SemgrepRunner (priority 2), and
PipAuditRunner (priority 3). See PIPELINE_PRIORITY = 4.

Subprocess invocation (requirements file)::

    safety check --json -r <requirements_file>

    --json               Machine-readable JSON output (required for parsing)
    -r <requirements>    Audit a specific requirements file

Subprocess invocation (environment fallback — no requirements file found)::

    safety check --json

    Audits all packages currently installed in the active Python environment.

Auto-detection logic (in order of preference):
  1. requirements.txt in target directory
  2. requirements-dev.txt in target directory
  3. requirements/base.txt in target directory
  4. requirements/prod.txt in target directory
  5. requirements/production.txt in target directory
  6. Fallback: scan currently installed environment (no ``-r`` flag)

Exit code behaviour (safety spec):
    0   — no vulnerabilities found (output may be empty or valid JSON)
    1   — vulnerabilities found in older safety versions (< 2.0)
    64  — vulnerabilities found in safety >= 2.0 (NOT an error — valid JSON)
    other — real error (bad arguments, network failure, DB access issue)

Safety JSON output formats:

  Format A — safety >= 2.0 (dict wrapper)::

      {
        "vulnerabilities": [
          {
            "vulnerability_id": "51457",
            "package_name": "requests",
            "analyzed_version": "2.25.1",
            "advisory": "Requests 2.x...",
            "CVE": "CVE-2023-32681",
            "fixed_versions": ["2.31.0"],
            "severity": {
              "cvss_v3": {
                "base_score": 6.1,
                "base_severity": "MEDIUM"
              }
            }
          }
        ],
        "meta": { "safety_version": "2.4.0" }
      }

  Format B — safety < 2.0 (list of lists)::

      [
        ["requests", "<2.31.0", "2.25.1", "Advisory text...", "44715"]
      ]

      Fields: [package_name, affected_spec, installed_version, advisory, vuln_id]
      No CVSS data available in this format — defaults to MEDIUM severity.

Severity mapping (CVSS v3 base score when available):
    CVSS >= 9.0   → CRITICAL
    CVSS >= 7.0   → HIGH
    CVSS >= 4.0   → MEDIUM
    CVSS >= 0.1   → LOW
    No CVSS data  → MEDIUM (safe default — known vulnerability, unknown severity)

CWE mapping: All safety findings map to CWE-1035 (Using Components with Known
Vulnerabilities). OWASP category: A06:2021 (Vulnerable and Outdated Components).
These match pip-audit for consistency; the deduplication layer handles overlap.
